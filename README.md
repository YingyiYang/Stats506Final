# Stats 506 F20 Final Project 

For adults who weigh less than they were 10 years ago, what their current nutrient intake and demographic factors are considered important? 


## Code organization

- `Final.Rmd`,  `Final.html`: the write-up for this project 
- `Data`: 
  + `file_download.sh` : the shell script for downloading the required files 
  + `nhanes_files.txt`: the file names for the dataset on [NHANES](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/)
 - `finalProj.ipynb`: source code written in jupyter notebook 
 - `Results`: folder containing csv files generated by Python


## Overview

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conduct survey on people's weight history using 
questionnaire every year. The goal of this analysis is to use feature selection method to identify what types of 
nutrition and demographic factors are most important for adults who report to have less weight than ten years ago. 


## Data description

The 2015-2018 demographic, nutrient intake and weight history data are obtained from 
[NHANES](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/)


Key variables: 

|  Variable               | Description                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------|
| SEQN |  Respondent sequence number |
| WHD020 |  Current self-reported weight (pounds) |
| WHD110 | Self-reported weight-10 yrs ago (pounds) |
| RIAGENDR | Gender |
| RIDAGEYR | Age in years at screening |
| DMDEDUC2 | Education level - Adults 20+ |
| INDHHIN2 | Annual household income |
| DR1TKCAL | Energy (kcal) |
| DR1TPROT | Protein (gm) |
| DR1TCARB | Carbohydrate (gm) |
| DR1TSUGR | Total sugars (gm) |
| DR1TFIBE | Dietary fiber (gm) |
| DR1TTFAT | Total fat (gm) |
| DR1TSFAT | Total saturated fatty acids (gm) |
| DR1TMFAT | Total monounsaturated fatty acids (gm) |
| DR1TPFAT | Total polyunsaturated fatty acids (gm) |
| DR1TCHOL | Cholesterol (mg) |


## Core examples

We use weight loss or not as response variable to fit logistic regression and decision tree classification models. 
Feature selection is implemented using `sklearn` package in Python, and is based on model and recursive feature elimination, respectively.
