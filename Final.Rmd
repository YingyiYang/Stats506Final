# **Introduction**

The majority of adults in the United States gain weight with age. Investigation on 
weight maintenance has long been the health concern of people to prevent obesity 
and the possible complications because of the obese state. 

People's weight is controlled by both internal and external factors. Nutrient intake 
can no doubtedly affect weight. Demographic factors (such as age, gender, ethnic groups)
and socioeconomic factors  (such as education level and income) may affect adults' 
weight as well. It thus makes sense to identify the key factors among them to provide 
people with guidence to maintain their weight. 


# **Data/Methods** 

The 2015-2018 demographic, nutrient intake and weight history data are obtained from 
[NHANES](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/). We select some of the variables that are 
of most interest. The response variable are transformed into binary according to whether 
the respondent's weight are at least 5 pounds less than 10 years ago. 

We use function `featureSelection` to select the `n` most important features. The criteria 
for feature selection is set by the input argument `method`. Here we use two classification 
models: logistic regression and decision tree. We select features based on model and 
recursive feature elimination (RFE) respectively.

The detailed code can be founded in [github](https://github.com/YingyiYang/Stats506Final).


# **Results** 

We present results for four different types of feature selections below. 6 features are 
selected for each.

### 1. model-based, logistic regression

### 2. model-based, decision tree

![](https://github.com/YingyiYang/Stats506Final/blob/main/results/Model_tree.png?raw=true){width=400px}

### 3. recursive feature elimination, logistic regression 

Top 6 features are: 'RIDAGEYR', 'DMDEDUC2', 'DR1TTFAT', 'DR1TMFAT', 'DR1TPFAT', 'Female'.

### 4. recursive feature elimination, decision tree 

Top 6 features are: 'DR1TKCAL', 'DR1TFIBE', 'DR1TSFAT', 'DR1TMFAT', 'DR1TPFAT', 'DR1TCHOL'.

# **Conclusion/Discussion** 

From the above results, we can say that some common important factors are 'DR1TPFAT' 
(Total polyunsaturated fatty acids), 'DR1TMFAT' (Total monounsaturated fatty acids), 
'DR1TFIBE' (Dietary fiber), 'RIDAGEYR' (Age in years at screening) and 'DMDEDUC2' 
(Education level). The results are not conclusive because the feature importance for the 
same model also varies when we use different criteria. Further work such as cross-validation 
is needed to verify the results.
